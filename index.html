            <h2> Presentation </h2>
            <p> Since I was a child, I have always been interested in technology. However, I truly noticed my attraction for IT and computer science in high school, when I discovered what coding felt like. Since then, I have tried to aim my studies on computer science, and hope for my career to be in this field.</p>
            <p> This year I am a 3rd year student engineer at the ENIB (Ecole Nationale des Ing√©nieurs de Brest), in France. I integrated the school in 2nd year, after 2 years of preparatory classes in the Kerichen high school, in Brest, France.</p>
            <p> In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with my friends and attending gaming-related events such as LAN parties or conventions. This is what led me to join the GGLAN association in Brest, where I work to promote the presence of women in the organized events.<br>
            As I am very curious to learn, I also spend a lot of my time studying and looking into new things to learn.</p>
